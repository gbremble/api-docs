# Authentication


> Example request that includes authentication:

```python
import requests

api_url = 'https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/sessions/'
api_key = 'API_KEY'
api_response = requests.get(api_url, headers={'Authorization': 'JWT ' + api_key})
```

> You must replace the value assigned to `api_key` with your personal API key.

> Note that the sample python code sample in this documentation uses the python `requests` package. Installation instructions for `requests` can be found [here](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/); alternatively, for the more eager, you can run `pip install requests`.



To access Guidebook's Open API, you'll need to include an API Key with your requests. You can manage your API Keys in the [API Page](https://builder.guidebook.com/#/account/api/) of the Guidebook Builder CMS. Your API Keys grant significant access to resources related to your account, so keep them secret! Do not share your API Keys with anyone, and do not place API Keys in publicly accessible areas like GitHub or client-side code.

All requests to the Guidebook Open API need to have an API Key included in a header that looks something like:

`Authorization: JWT API_KEY`

You must replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.
