## How to Create a `PersonalizedSchedule`


```python
import requests

personalized_schedule_url =  'https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/personalized-schedules/'
api_key = 'API_KEY'
post_data =
{
	"guide": 1,
	"name": "Test Personalized Schedule Created via the Open API",
	"attendees": [
		1,
		5
	],
	"sessions": [
		13,
		42,
		47,
		101,
		118
	]
}
response = request.post(personalized_schedule_url, data=post_data, headers={'Authorization': 'JWT ' + api_key})

```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"guide": 18,
	"name": "Test Personalized Schedule Created via the Open API",
	"attendees": [
		1,
		5
	],
	"sessions": [
		13,
		42,
		47,
		101,
		118
	]
}

```


This endpoint will create a `PersonalizedSchedule` for your guide.  `PersonalizedSchedules` have an email invite component that is not exposed via the Open API. To publish these schedules to the end-users and send out email notifications, please sign in to Builder and use the UI there to publish and send out emails.

## How to Fetch Data on `PersonalizedSchedule`


```python
import requests

personalized_schedule_url =  'https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/personalized-schedules/'
api_key = 'API_KEY'

# This will return all `PersonalizedSchedule` you have access to
response = request.get(personalized_schedule_url, headers={'Authorization': 'JWT ' + api_key})
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
{
	"count": 2,
	"next": null,
	"previous": null,
	"results": [
		{
			"id": 1,
			"guide": 18,
			"name": "Example Schedule for Sales Team",
			"attendees": [
				6,
				7,
				8
			],
			"sessions": [
				1,
				2,
				3
			]
		},
		{
			"id": 2,
			"guide": 19,
			"name": "Example Schedule for Marketing Team",
			"attendees": [
				9,
				10,
				11
			],
			"sessions": [

			]
		}
	]
}
```


This endpoint can also be used to read data on `PersonalizedSchedule`.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/personalized-schedules/`

### Model Fields

Same as the fields used in creation with the addition of the following read-only fields

Parameter       | Type    | Description
---------       | ------- | -----------
id              | integer  | An unique identifier for your `PersonalizedSchedule`.
created_at      | datetime | Time when this `PersonalizedSchedule` was created - UTC.

### Filtering By Guide id

Including a query parameter `guide` allows you to filter for all `PersonalizedSchedule` related to a `Guide` you have access to (`Guide` 47 in the following example):

`GET https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/personalized-schedules/?guide=47`

In the following examples, we will assume that the id of the `PersonalizedSchedule` we'd like to modify is 71.

### Retrieving a `PersonalizedSchedule`

To retrieve an individual `PersonalizedSchedule` object issue a `GET` request like:

`GET https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/personalized-schedules/71/`

### Updating a `PersonalizedSchedule`

To modify an existing `PersonalizedSchedule` object, issue a `PATCH` request like:

`PATCH https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/personalized-schedules/71/`

The only fields you will be able to update are `sessions` and `attendees`.  Note that due to the complexity of `PersonalizedSchedules`, you'll need to sign into Builder UI and review the updates and publish updates to the app.  Publishing these updates is not available via the Open API at this moment.

### Deleting a `PersonalizedSchedule`

To delete a particular `PersonalizedSchedule`, issue a `DELETE` request to the url that points to the specific `PersonalizedSchedule` you'd like deleted:

`DELETE https://builder.guidebook.com/open-api/v1/personalized-schedules/71/`
